        Hi! I’m from Bangalore, born on June 24, 2002. I’m passionate about dancing and modeling, and I absolutely love playing cricket and badminton. When I’m not busy with tech, you’ll find me cheering for my favorite IPL team — I’m a big RCB fan!
      </p>
      <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
        Adventure is a big part of my life — trekking and exploring new places keep me energized and inspired. I enjoy meeting new people, discovering different cultures, and learning new skills along the way.
      </p>
      <p className="text-muted-foreground">
        Besides all that, I’m always curious and eager to grow both personally and professionally. Looking forward to connecting and sharing more!
